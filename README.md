# NumPy-Analyzer-Project
NumPy Analyzer project using OOP

## 📌 Project Overview

The **NumPy Analyzer Project** is a menu-driven Python application built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and the **NumPy** library. The project allows users to create and analyze NumPy arrays and perform common data operations such as mathematical calculations, array manipulation, searching, sorting, filtering, and statistical analysis through a simple console-based interface.

This project is designed for **academic purposes**, especially for students learning **Python, NumPy, and OOP concepts**.

## 🎯 Objectives

* To understand and apply **NumPy array operations**
* To implement **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python
* To build a **menu-driven analytical tool** using Python
* To perform basic **data analysis and statistical operations**

---

* User-defined dimensions and values

### 2️⃣ Indexing & Slicing

* Access specific elements using indexing
* Extract sub-arrays using slicing (available after creating 2D or 3D arrays)

### 3️⃣ Mathematical Operations

* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division

### 4️⃣ Combine or Split Arrays

* Combine arrays using vertical stacking
* Split arrays into equal parts

### 5️⃣ Search, Sort, and Filter

* Search a specific value in the array
